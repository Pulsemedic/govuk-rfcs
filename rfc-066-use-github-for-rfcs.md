## Problem

- The confluence wiki is closed to people outside of GOV.UK
- Not everyone is a fan of the wiki's user interface
- It's hard to keep track of changes to RFCs during the proposal period

## Proposal

- Move the RFCs to GitHub
- RFCs are proposed as markdown documents and discussed in a pull request

## Implementation details

- We'll create a repository **alphagov/govuk-rfcs**
- We'll create pull requests for each existing RFC so that we keep the current numbering system
