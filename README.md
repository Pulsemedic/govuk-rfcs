## Request for comments

RFCs are used to solicit comments on an idea or proposal.

To create an RFC, use the&nbsp;.

- You'll need to give it a number (you'll find what numbers are free by&nbsp;) and add the label 'rfc'.
- If you're still drafting the RFC, don't give it a number. This will prevent confusion if your RFC is published later than a lower-numbered one.&nbsp;

Ownership & publication

Once created,&nbsp; **you** &nbsp;are responsible for the lifecycle of the RFC, from the initial soliciting of comments from interested parties through to closure with the appropriate status.

- Put a link in the #govuk-developers slack channel
- Change the subject of the #govuk-developers slack channel to the RFC
- Send an email to&nbsp;[govuk-tech-members@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:govuk-tech-members@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk)
- Make sure you check "Notify watchers" when publishing the page
- Tell your tech lead, they'll announce it in the tech lead standup and put it in the weeknotes&nbsp;

## Status

RFC statuses are usually one of the following, but you can use additional ones if these don't suit your needs. Ensure that you populate the 'notes' section of the RFC explaining the status and when the next stage of the RFC is due.

- Draft - the RFC is still being drafted and is not yet open for comments
- Open - the RFC is open for comments
- Closing - the RFC is closing for comments
- Closed - the RFC is is now&nbsp;closed for comments, we're not doing anything with this right now.
- Agreed&nbsp;- This proposal has been agreed (link to pages/stories/artefacts that implement the solution in the RFC)
- Not Approved (or Rejected)&nbsp;- This proposal has not been agreed and will not be implemented
- 

Superseded - this RFC has been replaced by a newer RFC (include RFC number in notes section)

## What to write in an RFC

- **"Problem"** section: This section is intended for you to outline the problem that you're trying to solve.&nbsp;Give background information and describe the issues that the proposal aims to address.&nbsp;
- **"Proposal"** section: Outline possible solutions to the problem or suggestions that you'd like to be reviewed. This section shouldn't cover implementation details, it is purely to get feedback on an idea.
