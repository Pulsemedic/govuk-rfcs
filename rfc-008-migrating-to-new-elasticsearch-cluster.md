# Problem

We are migrating GOV.UK search from an elasticsearch cluster running elasticsearch 0.90.12 to one running elasticsearch 1.4.4. &nbsp;This can't be done as a rolling upgrade, so instead we have brought up a new cluster and plan to migrate the data over.

We're also moving rummager to run in a new cluster at the same time (on search-[123].api.production).

# Current status

elasticsearch-[123].backend cluster is running elasticsearch 0.90.12, and is the live search index

backend-[123].backend cluster is running rummager, talking to elasticsearch-[123].backend cluster, and handling requests from apps. &nbsp;Rummager is deployed on these machines under the app name "search".

api-elasticsearch-[123].api cluster is running elasticsearch 1.4.4, with all indexes created but with no data in the indexes

search-[123].api cluster is running rummager, talking to api-elasticsearch-[123].api cluster, but handling no requests from apps. &nbsp;Rummager is deployed on these machines under the app name "rummager".

# Steps

| Aim | How | Preparation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ensure that the latest version of rummager is deployed to the new cluster | There's a separate deploy job: "Rummager Test" | None |
| Prevent indexing on the new cluster, to make sure that any changes which get to this cluster aren't applied before we're ready | Stop sidekiq workers on the new cluster. Ack the alerts in nagios. Disable puppet on the new cluster (search-[123].api.production) to ensure they're not started again. | None |
| Copy all indexes from the old cluster to the new cluster | This should be possible using something like the env-dump-restore script, but we need to ensure the schemas are copied across.  
I'd expect this to take about 15 minutes to run. | Make a script for copying data and schemas between clusters |
| Change which machines searches and index requests go to, to point to the new rummager instances. From this point, users won't see updates in the search index until we finish the migration. | 

Various possibilities:

1. Change where the "search" name points to, to switch requests and indexing over to the new cluster.
  - This would require a deploy of puppet, followed by convergence (we'd probably force a puppet run on the machines we care about).
  - We'd then need to restart all affected apps.
2. Or, we could have a set of PRs to change all the applications which talk to "search" to try and contact "rummager".
  - Would require multiple app deploys
3. Fiddle with nginx configuration on backend machines to redirect requests to the rummager app there to go to the new cluster
 | Discuss, and prepare appropriate pull requests |
| Check that all searches are being served from the new cluster, and updates are being queued on the new cluster | 

Check that the old rummager application isn't receiving any traffic, and the new one is. Easiest way is probably just to tail the application logs, given that kibana is missing the data at present.

Also, check that the indexing queue is growing (using sidekiq-monitoring).

 | None |
| Wait for the sidekiq workers on the old cluster to finish draining the queue | This is likely to have already happened - it should be very quick. Just needs a check using sidekiq-monitoring. | None |
| Disable the rummager app on the old cluster | 

disable puppet to prevent restarts.

AND/OR: use a feature flag to say whether rummager should be enabled on the old cluster

 | Implement feature flag for whether rummager is running. |
| Check that all applications are running correctly.

There should be no errors (if there are errors, restart rummager, and work out why).

 | 

None

 |
| Copy all indexes from the old cluster to the new cluster again, to make sure that updates that happened after the initial copy are present in the new cluster. | Same scripts as run earlier. | None |
| Start the indexing on the new cluster, to catch up with the changes that happened during the migration | 

Start the sidekiq workers on the new cluster

Updates from the time we switched applications to point at the new rummager cluster should be in the sidekiq queue at this point, and this will apply them to the index in the new cluster.

 | None |
