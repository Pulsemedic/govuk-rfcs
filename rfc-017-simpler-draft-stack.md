## **Problem**

The current draft stack design is laid out as an exact copy of the `frontend`, `API`, and `management` VDCs in the GOV.UK vCloud Organisation. Because we've replicated all our data store clusters (Mongo and ElasticSearch), as well as our monitoring stack, we have over 30 machines in this VDC.

Additionally, because we've hit the limit of VDCs in our current vCloud Org, we've had to build this VDC in a new org.
