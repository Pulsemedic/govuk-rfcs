## **Problem**

Our applications at the moment are more tightly coupled to the infrastructure that is necessary or good. This is going to make transitioning to a containerised setup harder.

**Proposal**

This is therefore a proposal for how we should configure our Rails apps to use ideas from [The Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net/) to reduce this coupling. This details how Rails apps should behave because most of our apps are Rails, but these proposals can easily be applied to apps using other technologies.
