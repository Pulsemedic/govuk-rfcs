# Background

The publishing API allows us to represent links between content items by posting a links hash containing arrays of content ids.

For example

&nbsp;In our current model a `link` tells you 3 pieces of information.

- active\_top\_level\_browse\_page
- children
- content\_owners
- document\_collections
- documents
- email\_alert\_signup
- lead\_organisations
- linked\_items
- mainstream\_browse\_pages
- manual
- ministers
- organisations
- parent
- parent\_taxons
- people
- policy\_areas
- press\_releases
- related
- related\_guides
- related\_mainstream
- related\_policies
- related\_statistical\_data\_sets
- related\_topics
- second\_level\_browse\_pages
- sections
- service\_manual\_topics
- supporting\_organisations
- taxons
- topical\_events
- topics
- top\_level\_browse\_pages
- working\_groups
- world\_locations
- worldwide\_organisations
- worldwide\_priorities

Once upon a time, the publishing API retained the order of link
