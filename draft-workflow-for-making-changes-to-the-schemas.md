## Problem

Recently the publishing-api&nbsp;has begun to validate incoming payloads against the [govuk-content-schemas](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-content-schemas).

How it works now:

- The schemas are manually deployed using a [deploy task](https://deploy.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/job/Deploy_GOVUK_Content_Schemas/) in Jenkins for use by publishing-api
- Pull requests on&nbsp;publisher apps are tested against govuk-content-schemas master branch ([example](https://github.com/alphagov/calendars/blob/51a9583b4de80aeca53c9f3762f6412c24a3c951/jenkins.sh#L45))
- Pull requests on&nbsp;govuk-content-schemas are tested against the master branch of the downstream applications ([example](https://ci.dev.publishing.service.gov.uk/job/govuk_business_support_finder_schema_tests/configure))&nbsp;

This opens up two potential issues that could cause the publishing-api to reject valid content, causing errors or delays for editors.

**1) Undeployed changes in schemas**

Example:

- You add a field to govuk-content-schemas, but don't deploy
- You add the field to the content item payload in the publisher application. The PR will be green because the new payload is valid to the content schema on master
- PR gets merged and deployed
- Now the app will fail on production because publishing-api&nbsp;doesn't know about your new attribute yet

**2) Making schema changes with undeployed apps**

Example:

- You want to remove an attribute from govuk-content-schemas. You remove it from the payload in the publisher application.&nbsp;
- The PR is merged, but the application is not yet deployed to production
- Raise a PR on content-schemas to remove the payload. Downstream pass because the publisher isn't sending the attribute (but it's testing against master)
- When you deploy govuk-content-schemas the publisher app will be sending invalid content

## Proposal

This RFC proposes:&nbsp;

- Application tests are to be run against the **deployed** &nbsp;version of govuk-content-schemas
- Pull requests on govuk-content-schemas are to be tested against the **deployed** version of the downstream applications
- The govuk-content-schemas repo is to be **automatically deployed** from master for all environments
