## Problem

Historically, we've had "organisation tagging" on GOV.UK, but it's a bit
muddled. In particular, the value of "organisations" in the content store means
different things for different publishing apps.

## Model

There will be three organisation tagging options for any page on GOV.UK:

- **Primary publishing organisation** This is the publisher, or "owner" of the
  page.
- **Additional publishing organisations** In cases when there's more than 1
  organisation that has worked on the content.
- **Related organisations** The content is related to these organisations.

## Implementation

- The content store will expose the three organisation link types separately
- The search API will expose the three organisation link types separately, but
  also expose a compound field that contains all organisations
- We'll send the three types as separate dimensions to analytics, but also a
  compound field that contains all the organisations

## Usage

- Survey team can use primary publishing org from the search API to show
  breakdown per org
- Content performance manager can use the primary publishing org to show
  ownership
- Content transformation will use the primary publishing org to assign content
- We'll use all the organisations combined to do facetted search

## Mapping

### Whitehall

- The first lead org is the primary publishing org
- The other lead orgs become the additional publishing orgs
- The supporting orgs become the related orgs

### Publisher

- The primary publishing org will be **Government Digital Service**
- The current "Organisations" become related orgs
