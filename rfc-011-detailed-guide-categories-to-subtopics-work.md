# **Problem**

## Topic labelling issues

**Summary**

- 

We need to make some IA compromises to finish the work of [retiring the detailed guidance (DG) categories](https://gov-uk.atlassian.net/wiki/display/FS/Retire+detailed+guidance+categories) and replacing them with subtopics. This work started last year and was then put on hold.

- 

We need to retire the DG categories now so we can start linking mainstream browse categories to relevant subtopics. This change will benefit users browsing to specialist content.

- 

We need to create new high-level topics now to accommodate the DG content subtopics. The issue is how we label them. Most won't include a full list of child subtopics, and it won't be possible to fix this for some time.

- 

In the meantime we can take 2 approaches to how we label the topics: broader placeholder terms or more granular terms. Both have pros and cons. These are outlined below.

- 

We need to make a decision about which approach to take as soon as possible so we can get on and finish the task.

As part of the IA work to [retire detailed guidance (DG) category pages and replace them with subtopic pages](https://gov-uk.atlassian.net/wiki/display/FS/Retire+detailed+guidance+categories), we need to create some new subtopics to accommodate DG content that's not&nbsp;currently represented in the topic/subtopic taxonomy.

In the existing 2-tier topic \> subtopic hierarchical structure, DG categories are roughly equal to subtopics - ie they exist at level 2 in the hierarchy.

However, because subtopics can’t be created in isolation - they must have a ‘parent’ topic - we also need to create a number of new high-level topics to accommodate these new subtopics.

This means we’re forced into creating high-level topics before we’re ready. [Ideally we’d wait until we’d completed a full content audit of all the content on GOV.UK in a particular subject area alongside findings from user research and analytics.] In terms of the labelling strategy for these new topics, there’s a tradeoff between what those labels need to accomplish in the short-term versus in the future.

We think there are 2 approaches we can take to the labelling of these new topics (bearing in mind that topics and subtopics should be stand-alone subject areas that can pull content from multiple organisations and remain stable during government reorganisations).

# **Proposal**

## Approach 1

_ **We create placeholder labels for the broader topics we think we’re likely to need in future** _

This was the approach we took when we did the first phase of the DGs re-tagging work last year. For example we created a topic called ‘Crime and policing’ (we took the name of the old [policy topic](https://www.gov.uk/government/topics/crime-and-policing) because we believed these were being phased out at the time) so that we could move DGs from [https://www.gov.uk/browse/justice/rights/policing](https://www.gov.uk/browse/justice/rights/policing)&nbsp;to a subtopic called ‘[Policing and crime prevention](https://www.gov.uk/crime-policing/policing-crime-prevention)’ in the new ‘Crime and policing’ topic: [https://www.gov.uk/crime-policing/policing-crime-prevention](https://www.gov.uk/crime-policing/policing-crime-prevention)

We know there is other content about ‘Crime and policing’ on GOV.UK, and that additional subtopics will be added to this parent topic over time. When we discussed the DG work with the Home Office at the end of last year, our contact there said: “There is loads of content that we could collect into sub categories within crime – burglary, knife crime, fgm, gangs etc. This would be great for our users.”

However, we haven’t had IA capacity to revisit this and define those subtopics, so in the meantime there's only one subtopic under ‘Crime and policing’:

[https://www.gov.uk/business-enterprise](https://www.gov.uk/business-enterprise)

These are some of the new topic labels we’re proposing for Phase 2 of the work:

**Benefits:**

- 

More consistent with the existing labelling strategy for topics (although the topics do already vary somewhat in granularity)

- 

We’re quite likely to keep these topic labels (or close approximations of them) in future, so there should be greater predictability for users

- 

More scalable - in terms of workflow, it’s likely to be easier to add new subtopics to these existing topics as we fill out the taxonomy over time. For example, as part of the second phase of the DG categories work, there are already a number of new subtopics that can be slotted under the ‘Business and enterprise’ topic

**Cons:**

- 

The big drawback to this approach is the temporary lack of comprehensiveness. The new topics will remain incomplete (i.e. many of the subtopics will be missing) for some time, until we’re able to revisit them as part of the longer-term IA plans to complete the topic/subtopic taxonomy

- 

Users who see only an incomplete list of subtopics on one of these topic pages (most likely arriving on the topic page via search) may think that GOV.UK only publishes content relating to those subtopics, or know this not to be the case and think we’ve made a mistake. To mitigate this, we could exclude specific topic pages from search until they’re more complete. We could also perhaps there are ways we can communicate to users on the relevant topic pages that we know the topics are incomplete and we’re working on it, similar to the beta labelling that was used in transition.?

- 

Organisations who publish content relating to these topics may wonder why the topics are incomplete and think we’ve done a bad job. We’re currently planning some comms to organisations who use DG categories about the work we’re doing to replace the browse pages with subtopics. In the comms we’re explaining that we know the subtopics won’t be perfect at this stage, and that we’ll revisit them in due course. We’re also planning to turn this comms into a blog post after the election, but there’s a risk that some organisations won’t read either of those

## Approach 2

_ **We create narrower topic labels that try to describe only subtopics beneath them** _

This was the pragmatic approach we took for the HMRC transition when we needed to create subtopics for Tax credits and Child Benefit. The obvious parent topic here is ‘Benefits’ but currently it’s only these two benefits that exist as subtopics. The topic was therefore labelled ‘Tax credits and Child Benefit’ (with a view to it changing to ‘Benefits’ in future - the slug is /benefits-credits so that only the topic heading will need to change when the topic is expanded in future).

Adopting this approach for topic labels where we only need 1 subtopic for the purposes of the DG re-tagging work is quite challenging. It would be a case of either slightly tweaking the wording of the subtopic label - or simply duplicating it. For example, the DG category ‘Pet travel and welfare’ [https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/travel-abroad/pet-travel-and-welfare](https://www.gov.uk/browse/abroad/travel-abroad/pet-travel-and-welfare) (containing only 5 DGs) exists in isolation from any other subtopic or topic in the existing taxonomy. Adopting approach 1, we’d create a parent topic like ‘Travelling abroad’ with a view to filling this out with other relevant subtopics in due course. Adopting approach 2, we might have to label it something like ‘Pet travel’.

**Pros:**

- 

Sets user expectations more accurately

- 

If we make the slugs generic in anticipation of future labels, then this approach can also be scalable if it’s just the topic headings that get changed later

**Cons:**

- 

Lack of consistency in the topic labelling

- 

Doesn’t make enough distinction in the hierarchal relationships - so for example, if a user saw the similar/overlapping topic and subtopic labels in search results how would they know which one to pick? Conceptually, topics are designed to be higher-level groupings that help users to browse content in broader subject areas. As with approach 1, we could exclude specific topic pages from search.

- 

Makes the topic page look strange if the subtopics are essentially duplications of the topic label

- 

We know we’ll definitely need to change these topic labels in future, which creates more unpredictability for users

# Current status

We want to finish the DG categories work as quickly as possible so we can get on with the next task of [linking mainstream browse to topics and subtopics](https://gov-uk.atlassian.net/wiki/display/FS/Linking+mainstream+browse+to+topics+and+sub-topics), which will improve user journeys for people looking for specialist content.

We’ve already completed some of the work by adopting approach 1. If we change approach at this point before completing the second phase of this work, do we need to revisit the broader topic labels we’ve created already to make them more in line with approach 2?

The issue is whether it’s acceptable to have an interim period between completing this piece of work and the much longer-term piece of work to fill the gaps in the topic/subtopic taxonomy, during which a number of topics will be incomplete.
