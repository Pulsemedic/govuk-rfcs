## Context

The problem was originally discussed in [RFC 39](https://gov-uk.atlassian.net/wiki/RFC 39: Embedded relational content in govspeak), agreeing on a [rough proposed solution](https://gov-uk.atlassian.net/wiki/display/GOVUK/RFC+39%3A+Embedded+relational+content+in+govspeak?focusedCommentId=44761325#comment-44761325)&nbsp;but became dormant for ~6 months. This was partly due to dependencies on [dependency resolution](https://gov-uk.atlassian.net/wiki/display/GOVUK/RFC+40%3A+Dependency+Resolution) and [supporting content items without URLs](https://gov-uk.atlassian.net/wiki/display/GOVUK/RFC+43%3A+Content+items+without+a+base+path), which did not exist at the time.&nbsp;

Although this document attempts to summarise the issue, it's highly recommended that you&nbsp;[read the original RFC](https://gov-uk.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/RFC%2039:%20Embedded%20relational%20content%20in%20govspeak)&nbsp;for context, before commenting on this one.

The work was [picked up again recently](https://github.com/alphagov/publishing-api/blob/9295bd3de3b6b5395d39784daae0f6cac4f6862b/doc/arch/embedded-content-in-govspeak.md), starting from the previously agreed solution, where concerns were raised and we decided to re-evaluate the proposed solution -&nbsp;It's been a long time this the last discussion:

- Team turnover: many people involved in that discussion are no longer, and some&nbsp;who've joined since.
- Through migration we've learnt a lot about new architecture and hopefully have a better understanding of it.

## Qualities of an ideal solution

- Minimal logic in Frontend applications, with the long-term goal of static frontends
- Content store is a useful API to 3rd Parties without additional work
- Content items can be consumed/processed by search
- When an embedded dependency changes any documents containing it are automatically updated in a timely fashion
- The embed content templates and their CSS/JS stay in sync with each other

Each of the proposals describes where the responsibilities sit within the architecture, and what would need to happen in common scenarios where something changes:

- embedded dependency changed: a embeddable piece of content (eg, a contact or attachment) is updated in a publishing app by an editor
- embedded content layout changed: the template for rendering an embeddedable piece if content (eg, contact.html.erb) is updated/deployed by a developer
- govspeak rendering output changes: all content items are re-rendered and updated in content-store

## Proposals

It's assumed that the govspeak going in to publishing-api, from publishing apps, would have a standardised format for embedded content, that includes

- a unique identifier for the embedded content
- the type of embedded content

### 1. 100% Publishing: Govspeak rendering, and embedded content, is done on the Publishers (or shared service)

- content-store returns fully rendered HTML, including embedded content
- publishing-api responsible for converting govspeak to HTML
- publishing-api responsible for converting embedded dependencies to HTML
- publishing api responsible for tracking changes to embedded dependencies and re-generating HTML
- frontend apps receive content item with plain HTML - no dependencies in links hash

When...

- embedded dependency changed: publishing api needs to track when an embedded dependency has changed, re-render the HTML, and update content-store
- embedded content layout changed: all content items with an embedded dependency of that layout type are re-rendered and updated in content-store
- govspeak rendering output changes: all content items are re-rendered and updated in content-store

Pros

- complexity limited to publishing api
- frontend apps and publishing api are easier to reason about
- best perfomance for users - rendering is done once and cached in content store
- publishing apps don't have to send embedded dependencies in links hash

Cons

- changes to embedded dependency template will require re-rendering a lot of content (eg, all publishings)
- changes to govspeak rendering will require re-rendering all content with govspeak
- govspeak HTML can be out of sync with CSS/JS
- embedded dependency template HTML can be out of sync with&nbsp;CSS/JS

### 2. Hybrid: Govspeak rendering&nbsp;

- content-store returns partially rendered HTML, with embedded placeholders (eg, SSI-style syntax)
- publishing-api responsible for converting govspeak to HTML with embed placeholders
- publishing-api responsible for exposing embedded depencency data in links hash
- publishing api responsible for embedded dependencies links hash being up to date
- frontend receives content item HTML with embedded placeholders
- frontend parses HTML for placeholders and renders&nbsp;embedded dependency templates with data from links hash

When...

- embedded dependency changed: dependency resolution will update the content item, and frontend will automatically reflect
- embedded content layout changed:&nbsp;frontend will automatically reflect
- govspeak rendering output changes: all content items need to be re-rendered and updated in content-store

Pros

- Common updated case, embedded dependencys changing, doesn't require re-rendering
- embedded dependency templates HTML can be kept in sync with&nbsp;CSS/JS
- publishing apps don't have to send embedded dependencies in links hash (can be infered while processing govspeak to placeholders)

Cons

- Complexity is spread across publishing-api and frontend apps, harder to reason about
- Possible additional microservice dependencies for frontends to avoid duplicating embedding logic
- govspeak HTML can be out of sync with it's CSS/JS
- Makes content store a less useful API for 3rd parties (but not in an obvious way)

### 3. 100% Frontend:&nbsp;Govspeak rendering, and embedded content, is done by Frontends (or shared service)

- content-store returns raw govspeak, no HTML
- embedded dependency data is included in links hash
- frontend renders govspeak to HTML

When...

- embedded dependency changed: dependency resolution will update the content item, and frontend will automatically reflect
- embedded content layout changed:&nbsp;frontends will automatically reflect
- govspeak rendering output changes: frontends will automatically reflect

Pros

- embedded dependency template HTML kept in sync with&nbsp;CSS/JS
- govspeak HTML kept in sync with it's CSS/JS
- govspeak complexity is limited to frontend only

Cons

- Publishing apps have to explicitly include dependent content in it's links hash (as publishing api is unaware of govspeak)
- Rendering of govspeak is done repeatedly - could be performance issue
- Increases complexity in frontends
- Makes content store a less useful API for 3rd parties
