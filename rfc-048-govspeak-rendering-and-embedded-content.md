## Context

The problem was originally discussed in [RFC 39](https://gov-uk.atlassian.net/wiki/RFC 39: Embedded relational content in govspeak), agreeing on a [rough proposed solution](https://gov-uk.atlassian.net/wiki/display/GOVUK/RFC+39%3A+Embedded+relational+content+in+govspeak?focusedCommentId=44761325#comment-44761325)&nbsp;but became dormant for ~6 months. This was partly due to dependencies on [dependency resolution](https://gov-uk.atlassian.net/wiki/display/GOVUK/RFC+40%3A+Dependency+Resolution) and [supporting content items without URLs](https://gov-uk.atlassian.net/wiki/display/GOVUK/RFC+43%3A+Content+items+without+a+base+path), which did not exist at the time.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Although this document attempts to summarise the issue, it's highly recommended that you&nbsp;[read the original RFC](https://gov-uk.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/RFC%2039:%20Embedded%20relational%20content%20in%20govspeak) for context, before commenting on this one.
