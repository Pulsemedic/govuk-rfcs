## Problem

Currently the official way to add ad-hoc redirects is to [add them into one of the CSV files in router-data](https://github.gds/gds/router-data) and deploy that repo. However, this is unnecessarily complex; it is slow to run, and requires an explicit deployment every time; and it often fails because existing redirects have themselves moved, meaning developers have to do extra work to resolve things.

In addition, publishing-api has taken on the goal of containing the canonical list of content and routes on the site. But items added directly to via router-data are not recorded in publishing-api, making this harder to achieve. Also, since publishing-api now does record history, it can also fulfil the role of audit log which was one of the reasons behind creating router-data in the first place.

Therefore we should aim to migrate the functionality of adding redirects into that publishing-api. There are a few ways this could be done:

- Create a minimal standalone “redirects” app that puts redirect items into publishing-api
- Add a web interface to publishing-api to add redirects (and potentially other content-items) directly
- Get developers to PUT new redirects to publishing-api via curl or equivalent
- Write a rake task that adds a redirect, which can be called via the existing rake runner in Jenkins - or add a specific Jenkins job to call this task with the relevant parameters

Whichever option is chosen, it will also be necessary to backport all the existing redirects from router-data into publishing-api via a rake task or migration.

Proposal

### Option 1: Standalone redirects app

We create a new publishing app whose only responsibility is to add redirects to publishing-api. This could be very simple, perhaps only allowing the functionality to put redirect content items and not even supporting browsing existing items.

Pros: simple interface, easy to add redirects  
Cons: added complexity of maintaining a whole new app for a single task

### Option 2: Add a web interface to publishing-api

Similar to option 1, except that the interface to add redirects lives directly in publishing-api.

Pros: simple interface, no need for separate app  
Cons: Needs added configuration to make publishing-api directly addressable; undesirable precedent in turning API into a web app

### Option 3: Get devs to send new redirects to publishing-api manually

This involves no up-front developer work. Under this option, to add a redirect devs would have to send PUT requests manually on the command line via curl or equivalent.

Pros: No work required except for documentation  
Cons: Annoying for devs, as it would require constructing the request in the appropriate format on the command line each time

### Option 4: Create a rake task in publishing-api to add a redirect

We add a rake task in publishing-api which calls the existing command actions to create a new redirect item, passing the correct payload for a redirect with the specific parameters (old path, new path, redirect type) interpolated. This task could be run from the generic Jenkins rake task runner, or a new job could be added to Jenkins to accept the parameters specifically and run the rake task.

Pros: Simple to set up, relatively simple to use  
Cons: No helpful interface
